# NodeJS MUD
This small project was originally created as a way to learn NodeJS from the ground up. Eventually
the idea became more then merely a simple learning project and is now aimed to provide a unique MUD
experience within a NodeJS project.

## Founding Ideas
As this project is only a fledgling by nature, there are some core ideas that it is built off
of.

 * Use a RESTful architecture for games, players, and app interface.
 * Build a MUD that allows players to communicate simply between each other in a simple dungeon.
 * _FUTURE_: Create a rendering of the MUD environment using simple Raycasting techniques.
